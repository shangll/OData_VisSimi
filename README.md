Unpacking similarity effects in visual memory search: categorical, semantic, and visual contributions

The size of the data file exceeds the allowable limit for uploading here...

- Files ending with "_Raw.csv" are raw data, while the others containing "data" and "exp" labels represent data processed after each step.
  - "exp1b" is the LTM task data, while "exp2" is the STM task data. There is no Experiment 1a. Experiments 1a is an earlier online experiment investigating LTM. This experiment corresponds to Experiment 1a in Shang et al., 2024 and was not included in the current study. Experiments 1a and 1b used the same experimental code (both were LTM tasks), but for different research questions, and some key parameters (e.g., 50% distractor trials instead of 80%) were adjusted in 1b to make it comparable to the STM experiment (Experiment 2)
- The file named "img_alex_simi.csv" is the visual similarity matrix, and "img_w2v_simi.csv" is the image semantic similarity matrix.
- "simi_all.csv" is the summary of all similarity analysis data.
